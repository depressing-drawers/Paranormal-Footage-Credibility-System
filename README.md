# Paranormal-Footage-Credibility-System
Windows form application to rate the credibility of any given paranormal footage

"The Paranormal Footage Credibility (PFC) Rating System is a scoring system designed to rate the potential credibility of any footage purporting
to show paranormal activity (not the movie). This system starts by assuming 100% credibility for any given footage and converts this into a
points system, 100 being the maximum or absolutely credible footage. As elements from the checklist are selected, they are individually weighted
to represent the amount of credibility eroded by their inclusion. This is not to say it is impossible for footage with a low credibility score
to be genuine, but instead represents if it is probable, rather than possible.
